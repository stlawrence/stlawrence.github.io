<p>I have 18 years of experience in Software Development largely in Web Server product development and customizations. Much of this experience was using the Linux, Apache/Tomcat, Java technology stack; additionally I have spent the last 8 years working with Microsoft ASP.Net C# technologies (MVC, WebAPI, Unity, Windsor Castle, Entity, ServiceStack) as well as Microsoft SharePoint (2007, 2010, 2013). I have experience with Cloud Technologies such as AWS and Azure, having used the former to set up several non-technical clients with hosted customized solutions and building a cloud monitoring/management application utilizing AWS APIs for a cloud reseller. I enjoy working with front end technologies like JQuery, AngularJS and Bootstrap. I have a strong database background including using TSQL/PLSQL/PLPGSQL for SqlServer, Oracle and Postgres. I am a strong believer in test driven development, continuous integration, loosely coupled architectures (MSMQ, RabbitMQ) and Design Patterns. I have managed teams of developers, as well as worked directly with clients. I believe that my product development background helps me to build more robust and maintainable solutions for my clients and to look beyond implementing a fix to some immediate problem, instead looking at all the requirements to creating a real useable system.</p>

<p>In the role of Lead Application Architect for the Enterprise Data group I was involved in the full project lifecycle, from requirements gathering through implementation and deployment. I utilized .NET MVC/WebAPI, AngularJS, Mustache, JQuery, JQueryUI, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Bootstrap UI, CSS, Entity Framework, ORMLite, SqlServer, Unity, and Ninject to produce five major applications that are all heavily used by the Trading Desk, Operations, and Support Staff.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Security Data Service/Management – Two MVC5/WebAPI servers, one providing an external facing Web Service API, the other providing the User Interface using AngularJS, Bootstrap UI. The application integrates multiple data sources with a generic approval engine to allow users to retrieve, import, update, validate and approve Security Master Data.</p></li>
<li><p>Portfolio Analytics Hub – A MVC4/WebAPI application utilizing AngularJS and Bootstrap UI on the front end, SqlServer accessed via an ORMLite Data Access Layer on the backend. Integrated Tableau Reports (via their JavaScript API which I wrapped in AngularJS directives), SSRS Reports, Silverlight Dashboards, and other custom web based reports. Provided CMS like capabilities for report management and presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Data Surveillance Application and Dashboard – MVC5/WebAPI application utilizing AngularJS on the front end and SqlServer accessed via an ORMLite Data Access Layer on the backend. Created pluggable architecture for integrating multiple ‘Check Types’ for custom/configurable data checks. Created a Subscription/Notification engine that allowed users to register for notifications matching specific criteria. The IDeliveryMethod interface allows for multiple delivery types (ex: SMS, web service call, and message queue) but currently Email Delivery is the only implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Managed Events Application and UI - MVC5/WebAPI application utilizing AngularJS on the front end and SqlServer accessed via an ORMLite Data Access Layer on the backend. This application provides generic Approval and Audit capabilities to other applications via Web Services and an aggregated view of all ‘Managed Events’ within the firm via a AngularJS powered dashboard and management interface.</p></li>
<li><p>NISA Data Services – MVC3 Web Application hosting multiple SPAs built with JQuery, Mustache, JQueryUI and Bootstrap. The backend utilizes Entity Framework as an ORM via a data access layer. Provides multiple data management interfaces that had previously been implemented in a number of MS Excel workbooks and Web 1.0 style asp pages.
During my time I introduced the use of ORMs (Entity Framework, ServiceStack ORMLite), Dependency Injection (Unity/Ninject), JavaScript frameworks and templating (JQuery, AngularJS, MustacheJS). I created multiple reusable libraries that are distributed via NuGet via an internal NuGet Server.</p></li>

<p>As the Architect and Lead developer on Cloud Services portal for managed hosting I Integrated with AWS web services and other RESTful APIs to monitor cloud resources and provide an aggregated view of hosted environments for clients. The application was written using Razor Views, JQuery, JQueryUI, Bootstrap on the Front End against a MVC3 Web Application that used a code first Entity Framework based Data Access Layer and Unity Dependency Injection on the backend. AWS APIs were called to aggregate system data via scalable background processes and cached using a CouchDB NoSql database for low cost retrieval.</p>
